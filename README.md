Technical decisions for accepting and canceling races
##### 1 Step: Customer registration
      The system will check the customer's account if it is active to initiate a ride request
        
##### 2 - Driver registration
      Drivers will only be able to go "online" when they have an active account and a registered vehicle
            
##### 3 - Request for new races
      The customer can only request a new race after finishing the previous one
    
##### 4 - Driver availability
      The system will check the availability of drivers and their proximity in km to the customer
    
##### 5 - Race cancellation
      Users and drivers will be able to cancel the race normally
